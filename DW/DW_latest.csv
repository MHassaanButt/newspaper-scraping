election. Critics believe that people were compelled to participate.","Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador led a massive people s march with an eye to the next election. Critics believe that people were compelled to participate.Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador led thousands of people on a march to the capital Sunday.Mexico is no longer run by oligarchy, now there is a democratic system whose priority is the poor, Lopez Obrador told to the crowd.The rally was a response to a large march led by critics of the president two weeks ago. Those protesting two weeks ago opposed Obrador s proposal to reform the country s electoral authority.Onlookers shook hands and took selfies with the president as he passed through Mexico City. Many waved flags of the ruling National Regeneration Movement (Morena) party.Obrador s march marked four years in office for the leftist leader. Jesus Ramirez, the presidential spokesman, said at least 1.2 million people joined the rally.Experts believe that this was the first such march led by a Mexican president in at least four decades.Lopez Obrador s march comes ahead of the next general elections slated for 2024. Mexican presidents are limited to a single six-year term, meaning he cannot run again.No to re-election, he told the crowd on Sunday.Nevertheless, the president hopes to see his party hold onto power after he steps aside.Three of the his allies and potential successors — Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and Interior Minister Adan Augusto Lopez — accompanied him at the rally.Clara Jusidman, founder of INCIDE Social, an NGO specialized in democracy, development and human rights, said that what is important is less the number of participants ibut rather why they participated.  According to her, many Mexicans feel compelled to support Obrador as they receive money from the government.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoThe opposition insisted that the participants had been forced to join the march, claims Obrador dismissed.Most supporters at the march had been bused in from different provinces across Mexico. Their transport was organized by the Morena party, unions and social groups.I come from Sonora by plane and I paid for my ticket,   America Verdugo, a lawyer, told AP.By contrast, Pedro Sanchez, a bricklayer who came with his wife from southern Mexico, told AP that his municipality had organized everything.During the course of his term, Orbador s government has been criticized for its increased use of military force and laws that have been constitutionality questioned in court.His plan to revamp the electoral system has proven to be his most controversial move so far. His proposals include improving democracy by limiting economic influence in politics and cutting candidates  advertising time.His opponents fear that the change could presade a power grab. They also believe that his plan could reduce the budget of the electoral commission and change the way councilors are elected.Obrador s approval ratings are around 60%. He owes much of his popularity to his social welfare programs aimed at helping the elderly and disadvantaged Mexicans.Referring to the rally led by the opposition, Fernando Dworak, a political analyst at the Mexican Autonomous Institute of Technology said that It was a serious mistake by the opposition to believe that the president can be beaten on the streets.So far, his Morena party won four of six races for the position of governor in last year s midterm elections, giving the ruling party control of 22 of Mexico s 32 states.This gives the party an important advantage heading into the 2024 presidential elections.ns/ar (AFP, AP, Reuters) ","Jesus Ramirez, the presidential spokesman, said at least 1.2 million people joined the rally.

response to COVID-19 but was forced to quit for breaking lockdown rules. He attempted to rehabilitate himself by appearing on ""I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here."" ","Ex-Health Minister Matt Hancock led Britain s response to COVID-19 but was forced to quit for breaking lockdown rules. He attempted to rehabilitate himself by appearing on I m A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here. Britain s scandal-prone former health secretary Matt Hancock was voted off the TV reality show I m A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here on Sunday evening, following a much-publicized attempt to repair his reputation by appearing in the hit series.Hancock was forced to resign in June 2021 after The Sun newspaper published surveillance video footage showing him breaking COVID-19 social distance rules that he helped devise. The tabloid caught him kissing and groping an aide he was having an affair with.As health secretary, he had helped guide the UK through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic and the vaccine rollout, despite Britain being woefully unprepared for a health emergency due to a lack of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff.Hancock s acceptance to appear in the gruesome reality show, which is set in the Australian outback, also caused controversy as he is still a sitting MP for the ruling Conservative Party.As a result, he lost the party whip, effectively being expelled from the party, and must now sit as an independent lawmaker in Parliament when he returns to London.Many viewers expected he would be voted off much earlier, but Hancock still made it through to the final three and beat eight other contestants in viewers  choice through phone-in voting during the three-week-long series that airs every night.He also earned some 400,000 pounds (€465,000, $483,000) by appearing in the reality series.During the show, the celebrities —  including singer Boy George, a former female English soccer player, a national TV news anchor, a national radio host, an ex-Rugby player and two soap actors among others — were given gut-churning challenges.They included eating the raw private parts of camels, cows and sheep and undergoing trials involving spiders and snakes.Despite making it to the final three, many Britons have been disgusted by Hancock s appearance, blaming him for apparent failings in the government s early response to the pandemic.Some voters are still aggrieved about revelations that several parties were held in Whitehall while the rest of the country was locked down.At one point during the reality series, a COVID campaign group flew a plane with a nine-meter (30 ft) protest banner demanding that Hancock leave the show.The lawmaker admitted during one episode that he had messed up during his tenure as health secretary and said he had signed up to the show seeking forgiveness.Despite being suspended, Hancock could still make a political comeback.In 2012, Conservative lawmaker Nadine Dorries was suspended for appearing on the same show. Nine years later, she was appointed to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson s cabinet as culture secretary.Former England soccer star Jill Scott later Sunday night was picked as the show s overall winner, beating actor Owen Warner for second place.With material from The Associated Press.Edited by Amanda Rivkin","As a result, he lost the party whip, effectively being expelled from the party, and must now sit as an independent lawmaker in Parliament when he returns to London.

He has not been told of his charges. A former US marine pilot, arrested under a veil of secrecy is being held under strict conditions inside a maximum-security prison in Australia, according to his lawyers.Daniel Edmund Duggan, who has been fighting his extradition to the US on unknown charges, is due to be transported to Goulburn s Supermax prison while being classified as a extreme high risk prisoner, reported Australian broadcaster ABC news.His defence lawyer, Dennis Miralis said that Duggan was wrongly classified and made a request for the attorney-general to release him.He also suggested that foreign interference by the US government might have led to the harsh treatment Duggan has experienced in Sydney.Miralis said that the Australian has been denied access to writing material and medical treatment.He s presently not even able to access pens for the purposes of writing the nature of his complaint, Miralis told the court.Duggan was arrested in New South Wales on October 21, the same week that Britain and Australia issued warnings about China s attempts to recruit military pilots.The British media had reported that over 30 pilots had accepted lucrative offers to train the Chinese military. China s foreign ministry denied any knowledge of the allegations made by two countries.According to Duggan s company website, Topgun Australia, he has spent more than a decade flying in the US Marine Corps where he reached the rank of major and worked as a tactical flight instructor.After leaving the US Marines, Duggan moved to Australia where he ran the  Top Gun  adventure flight company from the Southern Island of Tasmania. In 2014, five years before his arrest, the 54 year-old had lived and worked in China as an aviation consultant.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoDuggan s lawyer explained that currently, Duggan is an Australian citizen and had renounced his US citizenship.Reuters news agency reported that when Duggan was in China, he shared his address with Chinese businessman Su Bin. In 2016, Bin wasjailed in the US for his involvement in a high-profile hacking case regarding the theft of US military aircraft designs.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoPreviously Duggan and Su Bin also worked for a South African flight school which is now under scrutiny by British authorities for training Chinese military pilots.Duggan has been detained under Australia s Extradition Act, pending an official request from the US government. He has not been told his charges and details regarding his alleged offences remain sealed by the US government.This is unprecedented to have an Australian citizen placed on the most strict inmate restrictions, akin to people convicted of terrorist offences, said Miralis.Earlier this month Miralis raised concerns about the  dramatic and aggressive move to transfer Duggan to a maximum-security prison. He launched a complaint regarding the Australian s treatment in court.Miralis also said that he would file a complaint over the conduct of Australian intelligence officers during Duggan s arrest. He added that, until the complaint is resolved, Duggan s extradition should be put on hold.Mr Duggan is an Australian citizen. We ask the US not to interfere, said Miralis in early November.Lawyer Trent Glover, appearing for the US government, said the Department of Justice would file an extradition request before December 20. From the United States  point of view, this is nothing more than a usual extradition process, he told the court.Duggan s case will be heard in court in late December.ns/kb (AFP, Reuters) ","A former US marine pilot, arrested under a veil of secrecy is being held under strict conditions inside a maximum-security prison in Australia, according to his lawyers.

Rescue efforts are ongoing, and authorities have said children are included among the missing.At least seven people were killed on the southern Italian holiday island of Ischia after a landslide caused by torrential rain devastated a small town, an official said on Sunday.A newborn baby and two children were also among the dead, Naples prefect Claudio Palomba told a news conference, adding that five people were still missing.Dozens of emergency workers rushed to the island while rescue divers searched the waters off the coast, he said.Firefighters said the mud was 20 feet (6 meters) deep in some places.Mud and water tend to fill every space,   fire service spokesperson Luca Cari, told RAI state TV, adding that the search was difficult. Our biggest hope is that people identified as missing have found refuge with relatives and friends and have not left information about their location, he said.The mayor of the town of Lacco Ameno told Italian state television that rescue teams were continuing their search with broken hearts since children were missing.Authorities in Naples prefecture were coordinating with local rescue efforts, with an official from the prefecture reporting that some 167 people had been taken to vacant hotel rooms. Many people have been left homeless by the events.Some 150 firefighters and another 220 police officials had been deployed on-site to assist with evacuation efforts as well.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held a cabinet meeting on Sunday and issued a decree aimed at providing swift help to people in need following the disaster.The decree earmarked an initial aid package of €2 million ($2.08 million) and contemplated a suspension of tax payments for residents until the end of the year.The government expresses its closeness to the citizens, mayors and towns of the island of Ischia, and thanks the rescue workers searching for the victims, Meloni said in a statement.Heavy rains triggered the landslides on Ischia  on Saturday, with destructive waves of mud sliding down a hill in the small town of Casamicciola Terme.The landslide engulfed at least one house and swept cars down to the sea, emergency services said. The Ischia fire service said that at least one house had been buried under the mud and that two people were rescued from a car swept into the sea. Palomba, the prefect of Naples, said Saturday that the body of a woman had been pulled from the mud.Rescue crews continued their search Saturday and Sunday for victims and survivors, using small bulldozers to sift through the thick mud. Two people were rescued from a car that was swept out to sea.Additional emergency crews arrived by ferry later on Saturday, including teams of sniffer dogs. Officials on the island urged residents to stay at home, as many streets were impassable.Ischia is a volcanic island which lies some 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Naples. It draws visitors to its thermal baths and picturesque coastline.The landslides were triggered by intense rains that were the heaviest the island had seen in 20 years. Within six hours, it received 126 milimeters (nearly five inches) of rain.The heavy rains continued throughout Saturday, making rescue efforts difficult and delaying the arrival of rescue reinforcements. On Sunday, conditions began to improve.
